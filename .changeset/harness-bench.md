`runBenches` (`@abide/harness/runner`) and the `harness-bench` command run every `*.bench.ts` under an app's `src`, print each arm's time and the claim between them, and fail the run where an arm goes over its `CEILINGS` entry or a ceiling names no arm (RULEBOOK 43.29-43.33); `abide scaffold` writes a `bench` script that runs it, and the starter's agent notes say to measure with the harness (RULEBOOK 38.124)
